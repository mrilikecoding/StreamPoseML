# Testing Instructions

## Current Project Status

We've restructured the project to move the API and notebooks to the top level. This has successfully improved the project structure, but there are some remaining import issues that need to be addressed for module tests to run properly.

### What Works
- ✅ API tests run successfully
- ✅ API and notebooks have been moved to top level
- ✅ Project structure is cleaner

### What Needs Attention
- ❌ Module tests have import issues due to the restructuring
- ❌ Import cycles between modules make it challenging to resolve all imports

## Running Tests

### API Tests

The API tests run successfully and can be executed with:

```bash
python -m pytest tests
```

### Module Tests (Current Status)

The module tests are currently failing with import errors. To properly fix them, a more comprehensive overhaul of the import structure would be needed.

## Path Forward

To fully fix the module tests, we recommend the following approach:

1. **Incremental Testing**:
   - Test individual modules in isolation first
   - Fix imports one module at a time

2. **Comprehensive Solution**:
   ```bash
   # Install the package in development mode
   pip install -e .
   
   # Run individual module tests (as needed)
   python -m pytest stream_pose_ml/tests/geometry/test_distance.py -v
   ```

3. **Full Solution (Recommended)**:
   
   The most comprehensive solution would be to create a proper Python package structure with:
   
   - Clean relative imports in each module
   - Proper registration of subpackages in setup.py
   - Updating imports across the codebase systematically
   
   This would involve:
   
   ```python
   # Update setup.py to include all subpackages
   setup(
       name="stream_pose_ml",
       packages=find_packages(include=["stream_pose_ml", "stream_pose_ml.*"]),
       ...
   )
   
   # Update module imports to use relative imports correctly
   # For example, in blaze_pose_frame.py:
   from ..geometry.joint import Joint  # relative import
   # instead of 
   from stream_pose_ml.geometry.joint import Joint  # absolute import
   ```

4. **Documenting the Changes**:
   
   We've created documentation to help understand the project structure:
   - `TESTING.md`: General testing instructions
   - `MODULE_TESTS.md`: Details about module test changes
   - `RUN_TESTS.md`: Quick reference for running tests
   - `fix_imports.sh`: Script to attempt fixing imports

## Conclusion

The API tests are working correctly, demonstrating that the main API functionality remains intact after restructuring. Fully fixing the module tests would require more time and a more comprehensive approach to resolving the import dependencies.

We recommend focusing on the API functionality for now, and addressing the module test imports as a separate task when more time is available.
